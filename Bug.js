This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been properly initialized or set. This is common when using asynchronous operations like fetching data from an API.  The component might render before the data has arrived, resulting in the variable being undefined or null, leading to a TypeError or unexpected behavior.  Another common cause is incorrect lifecycle method usage, where you try to access props or state in `componentDidMount` before they have been set by React.
